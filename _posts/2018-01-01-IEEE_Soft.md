Our paper entitled "**App Store 2.0: From Crowd Information to Actionable Feedback in Mobile Ecosystems**" coauthored with Xavier Blanc from University of Bordeaux has been accepted for publication to the upcoming edition of the international conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE).

**Abstract:** Given the increasing competition in mobile app ecosystems, improving the experience of users has become a major goal for app vendors. This article introduces a visionary app store, called APP STORE 2.0, which exploits crowdsourced information about apps, devices and users to increase the overall quality of the delivered mobile apps. We sketch a blueprint architecture of the envisioned app stores and discuss the different kinds of actionable feedbacks that app stores can generate using crowdsourced information.
