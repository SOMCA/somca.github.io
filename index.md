SOMCA stands for "Self-Optimization of service-oriented architectures for Mobile and Cloud Applications". It is an associate team between the [Spirals Inria project-team](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/) (Lille, France) and the [UQAM LATECE team](http://www.latece.uqam.ca/) (Montr√©al, Canada). The objective of this collaboration is to propose a novel methodology to support the runtime detection and correction of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) anti-patterns in Mobile and Cloud Applications.
